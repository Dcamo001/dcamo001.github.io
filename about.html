        Hello! I am a travel/outdoors photographer and videographer who currently resides in Berkeley, CA. 
        Growing up in Herndon, Virginia, I spent much of my time outdoors exploring the woods and rivers surrounding my 
        neighborhood and developed a love of adventure, nature, and exploration from a young age. 
      <br>
      <br>
        My interest in photography started when I received my first camera as a gift from grandparents 
        just before a trip to Europe. From there, I sporadically picked up and put the camera down 
        through the years until 2015, when my family took a trip to Hawaii and I was overwhelmed by the colors and 
        sights. I discovered that one of my passions is capturing and sharing the world as I see it in my mind. 
      <br>
      <br>
        Since then, Iâ€™ve spent nearly every weekend shooting all up and down the West Coast, 
        mainly focusing on sharing landscapes and nature. My goal with this is 
        pretty simple: to travel and enjoy the outdoors while inspiring people to get outside, 
        appreciate their surroundings, and help to preserve them.
      <br>
      <br>
        All content within this site is my own. I edit my work using Adobe Lightroom, Photoshop (sparingly), and Davinci Resolve.
      </p>
