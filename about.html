    Hello! I am a photo/videographer who currently resides in Berkeley, CA. I grew up in Herndon,
    Virginia, and spent much of my time outdoors exploring the woods and rivers surrounding my neighborhood which developed a
    love of adventure, nature, and exploration from a young age.
    <br>
    <br> My interest in photography started when I received my first camera as a gift from grandparents just before a trip
    to Europe. I ran out of countless rolls of film before falling off of it. From there, I sporadically picked
    up and put the camera down through the years until 2015, when my family took a trip to Hawaii and I was overwhelmed by
    the colors and views. I rediscovered that one of my passions is capturing and sharing the world as I see it in my mind.
    <br>
    <br> Since then, and after moving from Northern Virginia to California, Iâ€™ve spent nearly every weekend shooting all
    up and down the West Coast, mainly focusing on landscapes and nature. Photography reignited my sense of adventure and the urge to travel
    and enjoy the outdoors as much as possible.
    <br>
    <br> All content within this site is my own. I edit my work using Adobe Lightroom, Photoshop, and Davinci
    Resolve.
